## My campus personal project
This is an application that scrapes the NSE to get company data that is the trading symbol, closing and change. I have also created the User interface using Flutter that show cases this data in a more informative and helpful way. 

Final intention is to use the app to notify you if a listed company hits a certain target price. this has not yet been done though so maybe in the near future.
